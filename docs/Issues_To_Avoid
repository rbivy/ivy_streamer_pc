# Issues To Avoid - OAK-D Pro Streaming System

This file documents critical issues encountered during development and their solutions.
Keep this for future reference to avoid repeating the same mistakes.

## DepthAI API Issues

### Issue: "X_LINK_DEVICE_ALREADY_IN_USE" Error
**Problem**: Using old DepthAI v2.x API patterns causes device lock errors
**Root Cause**: Incorrect device management and pipeline creation
**Solution**: Use DepthAI v3.0 API patterns
```python
# WRONG (v2.x style):
device = dai.Device()
cam_rgb = device.create(dai.node.ColorCamera)

# CORRECT (v3.0 style):
pipeline = dai.Pipeline()
cam_rgb = pipeline.create(dai.node.Camera).build()
with dai.Device(pipeline) as device:
    # Use device here
```

### Issue: "No available devices" Error
**Problem**: Permission issues accessing OAK-D Pro camera
**Solution**: Set proper udev rules for non-root access
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev ivyspec
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03e7", MODE="0666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/80-movidius.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

## Performance Issues

### Issue: Python Receiver Performance (~20fps with frame drops) [RESOLVED]
**Problem**: Software-only H.264 decoding in Python with OpenCV/PyAV
**Root Cause**: CPU-intensive decoding, poor buffer management
**Solution**: **CONVERTED TO GSTREAMER** - PC side now uses GStreamer only
- **Before**: Python receiver ~20fps with decode errors
- **After**: GStreamer receiver 30fps with zero errors
- **Performance Gain**: 50% improvement
- **Current Status**: PC side completely converted to GStreamer (no Python needed)

### Issue: SSH Authentication Inconsistencies
**Problem**: Some scripts worked, others failed with "Permission denied"
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent use of sshpass authentication
**Solution**: Always use sshpass for automated scripts
```bash
# WRONG:
ssh user@host "command"

# CORRECT:
sshpass -p "password" ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@host "command"
```

## Virtual Environment Issues

### Issue: Import errors and dependency conflicts (LEGACY)
**Problem**: This was an issue when PC side used Python receivers
**Current Status**: **PC SIDE NO LONGER USES PYTHON** - uses GStreamer only!

#### Pi Side (Still Relevant)
```bash
# Pi side - MANDATORY for Python streaming
cd /home/ivyspec/ivy_streamer
source venv/bin/activate
python triple_streamer.py
```

#### PC Side (Current Architecture)
```bash
# PC side - NO virtual environment needed!
# Uses system GStreamer packages only
sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad

# Start system
./start_triple_advanced_overlay.sh
```

## Network and Connectivity Issues

### Issue: Connection timeouts and failed SSH
**Problem**: No connection testing before attempting operations
**Solution**: Always test connectivity first
```bash
# Test network connectivity
ping -c 1 -W 2 192.168.1.202

# Test SSH port
nc -z 192.168.1.202 22

# Test streaming port
nc -z 192.168.1.202 5000
```

### Issue: Firewall blocking streaming port
**Problem**: Port 5000 blocked on Pi or PC
**Solution**: Ensure port 5000 is open for TCP traffic

## Development and Testing Issues

### Issue: Experimental code mixed with production
**Problem**: Multiple versions of scripts causing confusion
**Solution**: Clean separation of production vs experimental code
- Keep only essential production files
- Archive or remove experimental/redundant scripts
- Use clear naming conventions

### Issue: Poor error handling in scripts
**Problem**: Scripts fail without clear error messages
**Solution**: Implement comprehensive error checking
- Test dependencies before execution
- Provide clear error messages with solutions
- Include connectivity checks
- Use colored output for better visibility

## Camera Hardware Issues

### Issue: OAK-D Pro not detected
**Checks to perform**:
1. `lsusb | grep Movidius` - Should show camera
2. Check USB3 connection (blue port)
3. Power cycle the camera (unplug/replug)
4. Check for device permissions (udev rules)

### Issue: Camera busy/locked
**Solution**: Kill any existing camera processes
```bash
pkill -f "streamer"
pkill -f "depthai"
```

## Documentation Issues

### Issue: Outdated or conflicting documentation
**Problem**: Multiple README files with different instructions
**Solution**: Single source of truth
- One main README.md with current instructions
- FUTURE_SELF_GUIDE.md for quick reference
- This Issues_To_Avoid file for troubleshooting

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Virtual environments only for Pi side** (Python DepthAI streaming)
2. **GStreamer is significantly better** than Python for video reception â†’ **PC converted to GStreamer-only**
3. **DepthAI v3.0 API** must be used correctly to avoid device locks (Pi side)
4. **Robust error handling** prevents user frustration
5. **Clean file organization** reduces confusion
6. **Comprehensive diagnostics** (system_diagnostic.sh) save time
7. **SSH automation** requires consistent authentication patterns
8. **Automatic cleanup** essential for reliable startup (start_triple.sh)

## Recovery Commands

If everything breaks, use these commands:
```bash
# Kill all Pi streamers
./ssh_pi_robust.sh "pkill -f triple_streamer.py"

# Run diagnostics
./system_diagnostic.sh

# Complete restart with cleanup
./start_triple_advanced_overlay.sh

# Or step-by-step
./start_triple.sh                    # Pi streamer with cleanup
./test_triple_advanced_overlay.sh    # PC receivers
```

## Version History

- **v1.0**: Initial Python-only implementation (~20fps)
- **v2.0**: GStreamer integration (30fps)
- **v2.1**: Cleanup and robust error handling
- **v3.0**: **PC-only architecture** - converted to GStreamer-only (current)

**REMEMBER**: This PC-side repository works well when used correctly. Most issues come from:
1. **PC side**: Missing GStreamer packages, network connectivity issues
2. **Pi side**: Not using virtual environments, wrong DepthAI API patterns
3. **Both**: Poor network connectivity, port conflicts
